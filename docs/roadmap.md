# Photo Organization Project Roadmap (Revised)

## Project Overview
A system to organize and search physical and digital photos using local LLMs and vision models, with particular focus on identifying people across different ages and extracting contextual information.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup

### 1.1 Project Structure
- Set up monorepo with separate services for processing and web interface
- Configure development environment with necessary dependencies
- Create basic data schema for photo metadata

### 1.2 Database Setup
- Initialize Supabase project
- Configure vector storage capabilities for face embeddings
- Set up schema for photo metadata (dates, locations, physical storage info, etc.)

### 1.3 Ollama Integration
- Install and configure Ollama locally
- Select appropriate multimodal model (LLaVA, BakLLaVA, etc.)
- Leverage existing Ollama libraries for Python/JavaScript integration

## Phase 2: LLM Description Generation

### 2.1 Basic Description Pipeline
- Implement initial photo processing workflow
- Generate basic descriptions using vision model through Ollama
- Store descriptions in database with photo references

### 2.2 Searchable Description Database
- Create indexing for efficient text search
- Implement basic search interface for descriptions
- Set up schema for both generated and enriched descriptions

### 2.3 Description Enhancement Framework
- Develop system for manual editing/correction of descriptions
- Create structure for automated enrichment in future phases
- Implement versioning for descriptions to track improvements

## Phase 3: Photo Processing Pipeline

### 3.1 Dual-Path Photo Ingestion
- Digital Photo Path: Extract and process EXIF data
- Analog Photo Path: Implement special handling for scanned photos
- Implement checkpointing for incremental processing

### 3.2 Date Extraction
- Implement OCR for capturing date stamps in analog photos
- Create fallback mechanism using file metadata or manual input
- Store extracted dates in standardized format

### 3.3 Face Detection & Recognition
- Implement face detection to locate faces in photos
- Generate face embeddings for identified faces
- Set up database structure for reference embeddings of family members

## Phase 4: Enhanced Recognition & Context

### 4.1 Cross-Age Recognition System
- Implement multiple reference points approach for each person
- Create age-appropriate matching system
- Set up confidence thresholds and human verification workflow

### 4.2 Contextual Logic Integration
- Implement date-based constraints (birth years, known events)
- Add person co-occurrence logic (prevent duplicate IDs in same photo)
- Incorporate location and event context where available

### 4.3 Automated Description Enrichment
- Develop system to integrate person identifications into descriptions
- Create logic to enhance descriptions with date and location context
- Implement LLM-powered refinement of combined information

## Phase 5: Web Interface & Advanced Search

### 5.1 Comprehensive Web Interface
- Create UI for browsing photos with filtering options
- Implement functionality to correct/confirm automatic identifications
- Build views for comparing generated vs. enriched descriptions

### 5.2 Advanced Search Features
- Build natural language query capabilities
- Implement semantic search across photo descriptions
- Create family-specific search features

### 5.3 Visualization & Navigation
- Develop timeline view for chronological browsing
- Implement people-centric views (grouped by person)
- Create location-based navigation if geo-data available

## Phase 6: Refinement & Extensions

### 6.1 Continuous Improvement System
- Use verified identifications to improve recognition accuracy
- Implement feedback loop for LLM descriptions
- Refine contextual reasoning based on corrections

### 6.2 Batch Processing Optimization
- Improve resource utilization for processing large batches
- Implement priority processing for selected photos
- Add scheduling capabilities for background processing

### 6.3 Additional Features (Optional)
- Similar photo clustering
- Family relationship mapping
- Physical photo location management (albums, boxes)
- Export functionality for creating themed collections

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a limited test set of photos (~50-100)
2. **Description-First Approach**: Get searchable descriptions working early
3. **Parallel Processing Paths**: Handle digital and analog photos appropriately
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic features and add complexity gradually
5. **Iterative Improvement**: Implement feedback loops for continuous refinement
